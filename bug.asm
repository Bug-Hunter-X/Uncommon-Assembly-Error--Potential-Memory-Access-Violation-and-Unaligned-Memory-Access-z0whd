```assembly
mov eax, [ebx + 4]
add eax, 1
mov [ebx + 4], eax
```
This code snippet is attempting to increment a value stored at an offset of 4 bytes from the address in EBX.  The problem arises from potential memory access violations. If EBX does not point to a valid memory location, or if there's not enough memory allocated after the address EBX points to, this code will likely crash the program.

Another possible issue is that the instruction modifies EBX + 4 without verifying that the address EBX + 4 is properly aligned.  Certain architectures require memory access to be aligned on word (2 bytes), double word (4 bytes), or quad word (8 bytes) boundaries. Unaligned memory access can cause exceptions or unpredictable behavior. 

Finally, race condition is possible if this instruction operates on shared memory.
