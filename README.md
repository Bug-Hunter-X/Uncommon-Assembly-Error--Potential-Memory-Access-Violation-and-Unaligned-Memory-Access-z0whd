# Uncommon Assembly Error: Potential Memory Access Violation and Unaligned Memory Access

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in assembly programming: potential memory access violations due to unaligned memory access, as well as race conditions.

## The Bug
The `bug.asm` file contains assembly code that attempts to increment a value at a memory location, but it fails to account for potential memory access violations and unaligned memory access.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version of the code, which includes boundary checks and proper alignment handling.  It demonstrates how to safely increment a value in memory, avoiding common errors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Assemble the `bug.asm` code.
2. Run the assembled code.
3. Observe the potential crash or unexpected behavior (depending on the system and memory layout).
4. Assemble and run `bugSolution.asm` to see the corrected behavior.
